    "## **What is A/B Testing?**\n",
    "The purpose of A/B testing is to compare different content and design samples in pairs. However, this purpose may differ depending on the system in which we perform the test. In addition to being used mostly on applications, websites and advertisements, it is a test that can be applied in almost all decisions that can be taken thanks to the digital competencies we have. AB Testing outputs help us make accurate predictions. In summary, it can be said that they are experiments in which only one of more than one variable is changed and which variant performs better under equal conditions."

    "## **How to Do A/B Testing?**\n",
    "First of all, a decision should be made about which variable A B test will be performed on. To go through a common example in digital marketing, let's talk about an experiment to be done on the CTA (Call-to-Action) text of an ad image. Let's assume that the current advertisement image says \"Make an Appointment Now\", and if we are wondering how it will perform, \"Call Now\". In the final stage, these two alternative texts should be evaluated under equal conditions.\n",

    "**Randomness**: Test groups should be randomly and equally divided so that the results are unbiased.\n",

    "Levene's test is used to test the homogeneity of group variances. It is run when groups are two or more. In other words, it is used in independent groups t test and Anova test. It is not used in the t test in dependent groups where the number of groups is odd. The sig (p) value found as a result of the Levene test is checked. If this value is greater than 0.05, we say that there is no difference. There is no difference between the groups. So we say the variances are equal (homogeneous). In this case, the values ​​in the first row (t value, p value) are taken into account. If equality of variances is not achieved, the values ​​in the second row (t value, p value) are taken into account. For example: p of the Levene test Let the value be 0.949. Since this value is greater than 0.05, we say that the variances are equal (Equal variances assumed). And in the rest of the first line, we look at the values. Let the p value of the sample t test be found to be 0.123. If this value is less than/equal to p=0.05, the hypothesis is confirmed. Otherwise, it will not be validated. The equation in our example was: 0.123>0.05. In this case, our hypothesis was not confirmed. H0 accepted, H1 rejected."
